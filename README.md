# adversarial_handwritten_signature_detection

### Experiments 

1. The sign data that we have is user specific, and we have trained the CycleGAN on all the user Real and Fake Images. Since its trained on all the user Real and Fake. the model fails to generate the fake images for the asked used its just recreates the same image.

2. We tried with the user specific training, and trained the model on this. Its build releatively new fake images but structure wise is still the same.
